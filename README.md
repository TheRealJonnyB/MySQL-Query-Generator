# MySQL-Query-Generator
This Python script is an interactive MySQL query generator and executor. It helps users generate common SQL queries (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT) through a user-friendly command-line interface. Users are prompted for query details step-by-step, allowing even those with minimal SQL experience to create valid queries.
